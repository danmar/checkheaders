#summary checkheaders

= Introduction =

check headers in C/C++ code.

This tool helps users getting rid of unnecessary includes (reduce code dependencies and get faster compile times).

This tool is under development. It is hoped that it will be ready to be released within a few weeks.

= The future =

It shouldn't be too much work to add checks for:
 * implementation in headers.
 * order of local includes and system includes.
